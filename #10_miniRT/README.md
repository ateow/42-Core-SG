# miniRT (Raytrace)
The goal of your program is to generate images using the Raytracing protocol. Those computer-generated images will each represent a scene, as seen from a specific angle and position, defined by simple geometric objects, and each with its own lighting system.
- Functions allowed:  open, close, read, write, printf, malloc, free, perror, strerror, exit All functions of the math library, All functions of the MiniLibX.
- Project Requirements:
    - Display 4 shapes (Sphere, Cylinder, Plane, Cone)
    - Camera, ambient and lighting conditions
    - Shadows
    - Full Phong reflection
    - Checkerboard
    - Coloured and multi-spot lights
    - Bump map textures
   
### UI Controls
