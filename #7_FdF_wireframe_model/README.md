# fdf_wireframe_model
This project is about creating a simple wireframe model representation of a 3D land-scape by linking various points (x, y, z) thanks to line segments (edges).

Each number represents a point in space:
- The horizontal position corresponds to its axis.
- The vertical position corresponds to its ordinate.
- The value corresponds to its altitude.
